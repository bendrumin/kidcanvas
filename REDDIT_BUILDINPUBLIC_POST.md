Just shipped a Feed feature for KidCanvas (artwork gallery app) - Like Instagram, but private and meaningful for families

**Post Body:**

Hey r/buildinpublic! 👋

I just shipped a major feature for **KidCanvas** - a family-focused digital gallery for kids' artwork. And it's probably my favorite thing I've built so far.

## What I Built

**A Feed feature** - but not just any feed. It's like Instagram for kids' art, except:
- **Private by default** (only your family can see it)
- **Story-first** (every artwork requires a story - what your kid said, the moment, the context)
- **Actually meaningful** (no algorithm, no ads, just family memories)

Think of it like this: Your kid brings home a drawing and says "It's a rainbow dinosaur that eats sunshine!" Instead of just snapping a photo and forgetting, you capture:
- The artwork
- The story (what they said)
- A "moment photo" (photo of them holding it)
- Reactions from family (❤️ 😍 🎨 👏 🌟)
- Comments from grandparents, aunts, uncles

## The Pivot

I started building KidCanvas as a simple scanning/storage app. Then I realized the real problem wasn't storage - it was **losing context**. By next week, you forget what your kid said about their drawing. By next month, it's just a piece of paper.

So I pivoted to **storytelling-first**. Every artwork MUST have a story. No story, no upload. Because the story is what makes it precious.

## What's Different About This Feed

**vs Instagram:**
- ❌ No ads, no algorithm, no influencers
- ✅ Private to your family only
- ✅ Built around memories, not engagement

**vs Google Photos:**
- ❌ Not buried in 10,000 vacation photos
- ✅ Purpose-built for artwork
- ✅ Stories are first-class citizens, not captions

**vs Regular photo albums:**
- ❌ Static, one-way
- ✅ Interactive - family can react and comment
- ✅ Searchable, organized, shareable

## The Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js 14 (web) + SwiftUI (iOS)
- **Backend:** Supabase (auth, realtime, database)
- **Storage:** Cloudflare R2
- **Fresh feature:** Feed with reactions, comments, story-first design

## What I Learned

1. **Build for emotion, not just function** - Parents don't just want to store artwork, they want to preserve memories
2. **Constraints create focus** - Making stories required forced me to think about what actually matters
3. **Private > Public** - Families want connection without the pressure of public social media

## Current Status

- ✅ Feed feature shipped (web + iOS)
- ✅ Story-first uploads
- ✅ Family reactions & comments
- ✅ Real-time updates
- 📈 50+ families using it
- 🚀 Growing organically through word-of-mouth

**What's your take?** Are parents actually interested in a private, story-first feed for kids' artwork? Or am I solving a problem that doesn't exist? 🤔

*Building in public because transparency > hype. Happy to share code, metrics, whatever helps.*
