# KidCanvas Teacher Outreach Guide

## Quick Start: You Just Joined "Art Teacher Life Hacks" Facebook Group

Congrats! This is one of the BEST groups for reaching art teachers. Here's your action plan:

### Week 1: Observe & Engage (DO THIS FIRST)
**Don't post about KidCanvas yet.** The group will see you as a spammer.

Instead:
1. **Like and comment** on 10-15 posts about portfolio management, organizing artwork, or parent communication
2. **Share genuine advice** when teachers ask for help (don't mention KidCanvas)
3. **Build rapport** - be a helpful member first
4. **Watch for questions** like:
   - "How do you organize student artwork photos?"
   - "Best app for digital portfolios?"
   - "Parent-teacher conference portfolio tips?"

### Week 2: Soft Introduction
When you see a relevant question (portfolio management, artwork organization):

**Good Response Example:**
> "I was struggling with this too! I ended up building a simple tool to organize everything by student automatically. Happy to share if anyone wants to try it - it's free for teachers. DM me!"

**Don't:**
- Post the link publicly (seems spammy)
- Say "I built this app" without context
- Ignore the person's specific question

### Week 3: Value-First Post
Once you've been active for 2 weeks, create a value post:

**Example Post:**
> **How I Cut My Portfolio Prep Time from 3 Hours to 20 Minutes**
>
> Parent-teacher conferences used to be my nightmare. Sorting through hundreds of photos, printing samples, organizing by student...
>
> Here's what changed my workflow:
>
> 1. **Photograph in batches** - After each class, not at the end of week
> 2. **Tag immediately** - Name the file with student name while it's fresh
> 3. **Use a dedicated tool** - Not camera roll (I built KidCanvas for this, but anything works)
> 4. **Share digital-first** - Parents get links, only print for conferences
>
> Went from dreading conferences to having portfolios ready in minutes.
>
> Anyone else have workflow tips? What works for you?

### Ongoing Strategy: Be Helpful, Not Salesy
- Comment on 3-5 posts per day
- Answer questions genuinely
- Share KidCanvas only when directly relevant
- Offer to DM details instead of public posting
- Build relationships with active members

### DM Template (After Engagement)

## Email Outreach: School Websites

### How to Find Art Teacher Emails

**Method 1: School District Websites**
1. Google: "[City name] school district art teacher"
2. Go to district website → Staff Directory
3. Look for "Art Teacher" or "Visual Arts"
4. Copy emails to spreadsheet

**Method 2: Individual School Sites**
1. Find elementary/middle/high schools in target area
2. Visit school website → Faculty/Staff
3. Find art department
4. Extract email (usually firstname.lastname@schooldistrict.org)

**Method 3: Bulk District Search**
Some districts list ALL staff emails in one CSV. Google:
- "[District name] staff directory"
- "[District name] employee contact list"

### Target Geographic Areas (Start Local)
1. **Your city/county** (easiest to offer in-person demos)
2. **Nearby major cities**
3. **States with high teacher salaries** (CA, NY, MA, CT, NJ)
4. **Arts-focused school districts**

### Email Volume Goals
- **Week 1**: 25 emails (test templates, gather feedback)
- **Week 2**: 50 emails (scale what's working)
- **Week 3+**: 100 emails/week (optimize and automate)

---

## Pinterest Strategy

### Why Pinterest for Teacher Outreach
- Teachers use Pinterest for lesson planning
- Long-tail traffic (pins keep working for months)
- High-intent audience (searching for solutions)

### Pinterest Tactics
1. **Create KidCanvas Board**: "Art Teacher Portfolio Tips"
2. **Pin valuable content**:
   - "10 Ways to Organize Student Artwork"
   - "Parent-Teacher Conference Portfolio Template"
   - "End-of-Year Art Portfolio Guide"
3. **Each pin** links to:
   - Blog post on kidcanvas.app/blog (if you create one)
   - Direct to /teachers landing page
   - Free resource (in exchange for email)

4. **Follow art teacher boards** (1000+ followers)
5. **Engage with popular pins** (repin + comment)

## TeachersPayTeachers (TpT) Outreach

### Strategy
TpT sellers are:
- Already online-savvy
- Building email lists
- Looking for tools to recommend
- Potential affiliates

### How to Find Art Teachers on TpT
1. Go to TeachersPayTeachers.com
2. Search "art portfolio" or "art classroom"
3. Filter by **seller rating** (4+ stars)
4. Click seller profile → Find email/website/Instagram

### Outreach Approach
**Subject:** Partnership idea for art teachers

> Hi [Seller Name],
>
> I came across your [product name] on TpT - it's exactly what art teachers need!
>
> I created KidCanvas (free digital portfolio system for teachers) and thought there might be a natural fit between our audiences.
>
> Would you be open to:
> - Trying KidCanvas with your classes
> - Potentially recommending it to your TpT audience
> - Affiliate arrangement (if it's a good fit)
>
> Either way, love what you're doing for art educators!
>
> Best,
> [Your Name]
> KidCanvas.app

## LinkedIn Outreach

### Finding Art Teachers
1. **Search**: "Art Teacher" + [Location]
2. **Filters**:
   - Current Company: School districts
   - Industry: Education
3. **Connection request** (don't send InMail - use free connections)

### Connection Request Message (300 char limit)
> Hi [Name], saw you teach art at [School]. I built a free portfolio tool for teachers based on feedback from art educators. Would love your thoughts!

### Follow-Up After Connection
Wait 2-3 days, then send message:

> Thanks for connecting! Would you be open to trying KidCanvas? It's completely free for teachers - helps organize student artwork digitally.
>
> Takes 5 minutes to set up: https://kidcanvas.app/teachers
>
> Happy to answer any questions!

## Reddit Strategy (Subtle Approach)

### Relevant Subreddits
- r/Teachers (4M+ members) - Very strict, be careful
- r/ArtEd - Smaller but targeted
- r/teaching - Active discussions
- r/education - Broader audience

### How to Use Reddit Without Getting Banned
**Don't:**
- Post "Check out my app" (instant ban)
- Self-promote in multiple subreddits
- Ignore subreddit rules

**Do:**
- Be an active member (comment on 10+ posts first)
- Wait for relevant questions
- Offer help THEN mention KidCanvas
- Focus on solving the problem, not promoting

**Example Good Reddit Comment:**
> Question: "How do you all manage student artwork portfolios?"
>
> Your Comment: "I struggled with this for years. Tried Google Photos (too messy), folders on my computer (too manual), and even physical binders (nightmare).
>
> Finally built a simple tool that auto-organizes by student name. It's free and takes like 5 minutes to set up. DM me if you want the link - happy to share!
>
> In the meantime, the biggest tip: photograph work in batches immediately after class. Don't wait until end of week."

## Twitter/X Strategy

### Finding Art Teachers
Search these phrases:
- "art teacher portfolio"
- "organizing student artwork"
- "parent teacher conference art"
- "end of year art projects"

### Engagement Tactics
1. **Reply to relevant tweets** with genuine help
2. **Quote tweet** with additional tips
3. **Share your own tips** (not promotions)
4. **Use hashtags**: #arted #artteacher #teacherlife

### When to Mention KidCanvas
Only when someone asks "What tools do you use?" or similar

**Example:**
> Tweet: "I have 847 photos of student artwork in my camera roll and can't find anything. Help!"
>
> Your Reply: "Been there! I ended up building KidCanvas (free for teachers) to solve exactly this. But even without a tool, biggest tip: tag photos immediately with student name while it's fresh. Saves so much time later!"

## Direct Mail Strategy (Advanced)

### Why Physical Mail Works for Schools
- Email boxes are overloaded
- Physical mail stands out
- Decision-makers (principals, art dept heads) respond
- Higher perceived legitimacy

### What to Send
**Option 1: Simple Postcard**
- Front: Screenshot of KidCanvas student portfolio
- Back: "Free portfolio system for your art department. Visit kidcanvas.app/teachers"

**Option 2: Letter to Principal**
> Dear [Principal Name],
>
> I'm reaching out because I created a free tool that solves a common challenge for art teachers: managing student portfolios digitally.
>
> KidCanvas helps your art teachers:
> - Save 2+ hours per week on portfolio management
> - Share student progress with parents instantly
> - Prepare for conferences in minutes, not hours
>
> It's completely free for teachers, no credit card required.
>
> Would you be open to me showing your art department how it works?
>
> Best regards,
> [Your Name]
> [Phone]
> kidcanvas.app/teachers

**Option 3: Sample Package**
- Printed guide: "5-Minute Portfolio System Setup"
- One-page KidCanvas overview
- Personal note from you

### Targeting
- Schools with 500+ students (more likely to have dedicated art teachers)
- Districts with arts funding
- Private/charter schools (faster decision-making)

### Cost
- Postcards: ~$0.50 each (design + printing + postage)
- Letters: ~$1.00 each
- Packages: ~$3.00 each

Send 25-50 to test response rate before scaling.

## Conference & Event Strategy

### Art Education Conferences
Target these for in-person networking:

**National (if you scale):**
- NAEA Convention (National Art Education Association) - March annually
- AATE Conference (American Association for Teaching & Curriculum)

**State/Regional:**
- State art education conferences (every state has one)
- Regional art teacher meetups
- School district professional development days

### What to Do at Conferences
1. **Attend sessions** (build credibility)
2. **Network in hallways** (more valuable than sessions)
3. **Ask for feedback** ("I built this tool, can I show you?")
4. **Collect emails** (offer free resource in exchange)
5. **Follow up within 48 hours** (while you're fresh in their mind)

### Virtual Conference Strategy
- Many art ed conferences now have virtual options
- Cheaper to attend
- Still get access to attendee list (sometimes)
- Comment in virtual chat rooms

## Measuring Success

### Key Metrics to Track Weekly
- **Emails sent** vs **open rate** (25-40% is good)
- **Emails sent** vs **reply rate** (5-10% is good)
- **Signups from each channel** (email, Facebook, Instagram, etc.)
- **Engagement rate** on social posts
- **Best performing email template**
- **Best performing subject line**
- **Time invested** vs **signups gained**

### Red Flags to Watch
- Open rate below 15% (your subject lines are weak)
- Reply rate below 2% (your message isn't resonating)
- Zero signups after 50 contacts (landing page or offer issue)
- Getting marked as spam (slow down, improve targeting)

### Success Indicators
- Teachers reply with questions (they're interested)
- Teachers cc colleagues (word-of-mouth starting)
- Teachers share in Facebook groups organically
- Teachers request features (they're using it)
- Teachers tag you in Instagram posts (social proof building)

## FAQ: Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "I'm not getting any replies to my emails"
- Try different subject lines (test 3 variations)
- Send at different times (Tuesday 7am vs Thursday 4pm)
- Shorten your email (try 3 sentences max)
- Add personalization (mention their school or recent project)

### "Teachers seem interested but don't sign up"
- Friction in signup process? (test it yourself)
- Landing page unclear? (show to non-teacher, get feedback)
- Asking for too much info? (minimize required fields)
- Send direct signup link in follow-up

### "I'm getting marked as spam"
- Sending too many emails too fast (slow down)
- Using spam trigger words ("Free," "Click here," all caps)
- Buying email lists (never do this)
- Fix: Use professional email service (SendGrid, Mailchimp)

### "Facebook groups aren't engaging with my posts"
- Posting too much about KidCanvas (provide value first)
- Not active enough in general (comment more on others' posts)
- Wrong timing (post during teacher planning hours, not late night)
- Format: Ask questions, don't just share links

---
