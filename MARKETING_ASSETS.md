# Marketing Assets

## Screenshots Taken

I've captured the following marketing screenshots using Chrome:

1. **landing-page-hero.png** - Hero section of the landing page (viewport)
2. **landing-page-full.png** - Full landing page (complete scroll)
3. **login-page.png** - Full login page with Google OAuth button
4. **signup-page.png** - Full signup page with Google OAuth button

### Where to Find Screenshots

The screenshots are saved by the browser extension. They should be in:
- Browser extension temp folder (automatically saved)
- You can also access them through the browser extension's screenshot history

To access them:
1. Check your Downloads folder
2. Or look in the browser extension's saved screenshots
3. The files are named: `landing-page-hero.png`, `landing-page-full.png`, `login-page.png`, `signup-page.png`

## Logo Export

I've created a logo export page at:
**`public/logo-export.html`**

### How to Export Logo as PNG:

1. **Option 1: Using Browser DevTools (Recommended)**
   - Open `public/logo-export.html` in Chrome
   - Right-click on the logo variant you want (Large, Medium, or Small)
   - Select "Inspect" or "Inspect Element"
   - In DevTools, right-click the element in the Elements panel
   - Select "Capture node screenshot"
   - Save the PNG file

2. **Option 2: Using Browser Extension**
   - Open `public/logo-export.html` in Chrome
   - Use a screenshot extension like "Full Page Screen Capture"
   - Crop to just the logo area

3. **Option 3: Manual Screenshot**
   - Open `public/logo-export.html` in Chrome
   - Take a screenshot of the logo
   - Crop in an image editor

### Logo Variants Available:

- **Large**: 512x512px recommended (for high-res displays, presentations)
- **Medium**: 256x256px recommended (for web use, social media)
- **Small**: 128x128px recommended (for favicons, small icons)

### Logo Specifications:

- **Icon**: Gradient square (pink #E91E63 to purple #9B59B6) with rounded corners
- **Icon contains**: White palette/artwork icon (SVG)
- **Text**: "KidCanvas" with gradient text effect (pink to purple)

## Next Steps

2. Save all screenshots to a dedicated marketing folder
3. Use these assets for:
   - Directory listings
