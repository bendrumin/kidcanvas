## New Section: "Instagram for Kids' Art"

### Section Title (H2):
**KidCanvas: Instagram for Kids' Art (But Actually Better)**

### Body Copy:

**You know Instagram?** It made photos social. You share moments, get reactions, build connections. It works great—for photos of vacations, food, selfies.

**But for kids' artwork?** Not so much.

That's where KidCanvas comes in. We're **Instagram for kids' art**—except we're actually built for this purpose.

### What Makes Us Different

| Instagram | KidCanvas |
|-----------|-----------|
| Public feeds, algorithm-driven | Private to your family only |
| Photos are everything | **Stories are everything** |
| Optimized for engagement | Built for preserving memories |
| Ads, influencers, noise | Just your family, just your memories |
| Captions are optional | Stories are required—no story, no upload |

### The Key Difference

**On Instagram:** You post a photo. Maybe you add a caption. But three months later, you've forgotten why it mattered.

**On KidCanvas:** Every artwork comes with its story. What your kid said. The moment it happened. The context that makes it precious.

**The artwork is just paper. The story is the memory.**

### What This Means For You

✅ **Private Feed** - Only your family can see artwork. No strangers, no algorithm, no ads.

✅ **Story-First** - Every upload requires a story. You'll never forget what made a drawing special.

✅ **Family Reactions** - Grandparents, aunts, uncles can react with ❤️ 😍 🎨 👏 🌟 and comment.

✅ **Moment Photos** - Upload the artwork + a photo of your kid holding it. Preserve the full moment.

✅ **Searchable Memories** - Find "that rainbow dinosaur drawing" in seconds, complete with the story.

### Why We Built It This Way

**Instagram solved sharing photos.** We're solving **preserving memories with context.**

When your 4-year-old brings home a drawing and says "It's a rainbow dinosaur that eats sunshine," that moment is precious. Instagram would just be a photo. KidCanvas captures **the story**—the context that makes it meaningful years later.

### The Result

A Feed that feels familiar (like Instagram), but:
- Actually meaningful (stories required)
- Actually private (family only)
- Actually focused (on memories, not engagement)
- Actually purposeful (built for kids' artwork, not everything)
