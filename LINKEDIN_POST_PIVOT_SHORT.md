# LinkedIn Post: The Pivot (Short Version)

**Post Body:**

I just shipped a Feed feature for KidCanvas that made me realize: **we're not building a photo sharing app. We're building Instagram for kids' art.**

Here's the pivot that changed everything:

**Before:** Kids' art sharing app. Upload, organize, share. Photo storage, basically.

**The moment:** My kid brought home a drawing and said "It's a rainbow that ate a dinosaur!" 

I snapped a photo. But by next week, I'd forgotten she said that. The drawing became just another piece of paper.

**After:** Pivoted to Instagram for kids' art—but better.

✅ **Private to your family only** (no strangers, no algorithm)
✅ **Story-first** (every artwork requires a story—no story, no upload)
✅ **Feed with reactions & comments** (grandparents can celebrate in real-time)
✅ **Moment photos** (photo of child + artwork = complete memory)

**The insight:** Storage = function. Storytelling = emotion.

Families want emotion, not just function.

The artwork is just paper. The **story** is what makes it precious.

**What do you think?** Are parents actually interested in a private, story-first feed for kids' artwork? Or am I solving a problem that doesn't exist? 🤔
