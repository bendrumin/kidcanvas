# LinkedIn Post - KidCanvas Launch

Anyone else starting the year with fewer "MOM DON'T THROW AWAY MY ARTWORK" moments? 😅

(You know the ones — scribbles that vaguely resemble spaghetti but are apparently "a dragon fighting a dinosaur")

I just launched KidCanvas — scan, organize, and share your kids' artwork without the guilt or the clutter.

✨ Shareable family albums (yes, Grandma can see them)
✨ Tag by kid and age  
✨ iOS app now in TestFlight — accepting beta tester invites! Comment or DM if you'd like early access.
