- **Use trending sounds** - But make sure they're family-appropriate
- **Post consistently** - 3-5 times per week for algorithm favor
- **Engage before posting** - Like/comment on similar accounts 10 min before

## 🔄 Instagram Reels Adaptation

**Same video works! Just adjust:**
- Slightly longer captions (Instagram allows more text)
- Same hashtags work
