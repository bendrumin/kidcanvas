# Twitter/X Accounts to Tag for KidCanvas Pivot Post

## Build in Public Accounts (High Priority)

**@buildinpublic** - Main build in public account
**@IndieHackers** - Product builders community
**@ProductHunt** - If launching soon
**@makerlog** - Build in public platform

## Parenting Tech/Product Accounts

**@dadfounder** - Dad building products
**@momtech** - Tech for moms
**@parentingtech** - Parenting technology
**@KidTechReview** - Reviews of tech for kids

## SaaS/Product Building Accounts

**@MicroAcquire** - Product builders
**@StartupLJackson** - Product/startup community
**@levelsio** - Build in public legend
**@jackbutcher** - Product creator

## Parenting Community Accounts (if they exist)

**@momsintech** - Moms in tech
**@dadsoftwitter** - Dads on Twitter
**@parentsoftwitter** - Parents on Twitter

## Recommended Tag Strategy

### Option 1: Build in Public Focus
Tag:
- @buildinpublic
- @IndieHackers
- @levelsio (if relevant)

**Why:** Get visibility in product builder community

### Option 2: Parenting + Tech Crossover
Tag:
- @buildinpublic
- @dadfounder (if you're a dad) OR @momsintech (if you're a mom)
- @ProductHunt (if planning to launch there)

**Why:** Reach both audiences - parents AND builders

### Option 3: Minimal (Just 1-2)
Tag:
- @buildinpublic

**Why:** Avoid spam, focus on one community

## Who NOT to Tag (unless they follow you/interact)

❌ Large creators (unless you have relationship)
❌ Accounts with 100K+ followers (unless relevant)
❌ Random parenting accounts (stick to tech/product building)

## Best Practice

**Tag 1-3 accounts max:**
- More tags = lower engagement (appears spammy)
- Focus on communities you're actually part of
- Better to tag @buildinpublic alone than 10 accounts

## Recommended Tag List for Your Post

**Primary tag:**
@buildinpublic

**Secondary tags (pick 1-2):**
- @IndieHackers (if you're active there)
- @ProductHunt (if launching soon)
- @levelsio (if you follow/interact)

**Parenting tag (optional):**
- @dadfounder (if dad) OR relevant parenting tech account

## Example Post with Tags

```
Photo sharing app → Instagram for kids' art.

The pivot: My kid said her drawing was a "rainbow that ate a dinosaur." I forgot by next week.

Now: Private, story-first, family-only feed.

The artwork is just paper. The story is the memory.
