## LONG Description

**KidCanvas** is a family-focused digital gallery that solves the problem every parent faces: what to do with all your children's artwork.

Your kids bring home paintings, drawings, and crafts every week. They pile up on the fridge, then in drawers, and eventually you're left with a mountain of paper. You feel guilty throwing anything away, but keeping everything isn't realistic—and the best pieces often get damaged or lost.

KidCanvas changes that. Simply snap a photo of any artwork, tag it with the child's name, add a title, and it's instantly saved to your family's digital gallery. Smart scanning technology automatically detects and enhances artwork, making each piece look its best.

The entire family can access the gallery—grandparents, aunts, uncles, and other family members can see new artwork as soon as it's uploaded. No more mailing photos or trying to remember which drawing was whose. Search makes it easy to find "that rainbow drawing from last summer" in seconds.

Key features include:
- **Smart artwork scanning** that automatically detects and enhances artwork
- **Family sharing** so grandparents and extended family can see artwork instantly
- **Artist tagging** to organize pieces by child
- **Searchable gallery** to find specific artwork quickly
- **Collections** to organize artwork by theme, event, or time period
- **Favorites** to highlight the best pieces
- **Mobile-friendly** web app with iOS app coming soon

KidCanvas helps you preserve every masterpiece without the clutter. Start with 100 free artworks, then choose a plan that fits your family's needs. Stop feeling guilty about throwing away artwork—save it all digitally instead.
