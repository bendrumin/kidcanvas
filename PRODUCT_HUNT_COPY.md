## Maker Comment / Founder Story (Optional)

**Why I built this:**

As a parent, I was drowning in artwork. My fridge was covered, my drawers were full, and I felt guilty every time I threw something away. But keeping everything wasn't realistic — the best pieces often got damaged or lost.

I wanted a way to preserve every masterpiece without the clutter. Something that made it easy to share with grandparents, find specific pieces years later, and organize by child.

So I built KidCanvas — a simple, beautiful way to digitally preserve your kids' artwork forever. No more paper piles. No more guilt. Just every precious memory, safely stored and easily accessible.

**Try it free** — you get 100 artworks included, which is enough for most families to get started. Upload your first piece and see how easy it is.
