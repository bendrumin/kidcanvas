# KidCanvas Teacher Outreach Email Templates

## Template 1: The "Portfolio Nightmare" Email
**Subject:** Finally, a portfolio system that doesn't add to your workload

Hi [Teacher Name],

I'm reaching out because I built something that solves a problem I kept hearing from art teachers: managing student portfolios is a nightmare.

Between photographing dozens of pieces, organizing by student, and preparing for conferences... it's hours you don't have.

KidCanvas is a free digital portfolio system where you:
- Snap photos of student work in seconds
- Auto-tag by student name
- Share progress with parents instantly
- Export everything for parent-teacher conferences

Free forever for unlimited students. No credit card needed.

Want to see how it works? → https://kidcanvas.app/teachers

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. - Takes less than 5 minutes to set up your first classroom.

## Template 2: The "Parent Communication" Angle
**Subject:** Show parents their child's art progress in 2 clicks

Hi [Teacher Name],

Quick question: How much time do you spend photographing student artwork and sharing it with parents?

I built KidCanvas after talking with art teachers who were spending 30+ minutes per week on this alone.

Now it's:
1. Snap photo of artwork
2. Tag student name
3. Share link with parents

Parents get instant updates. You save hours. Students see their progress over time.

Free for teachers. Would you like to try it with one class?

## Template 3: The "Conference Prep" Email
**Subject:** Cut your parent-teacher conference prep time by 80%

Hi [Teacher Name],

Parent-teacher conferences are coming up. You know what that means...

Hours of sorting through photos, printing samples, organizing portfolios by student.

What if you could pull up any student's full art portfolio in 5 seconds?

KidCanvas organizes everything by student automatically:
- See progression from September to now
- Filter by project or date
- Share digital portfolios with families
- Export to PDF for printing

Free for unlimited students: https://kidcanvas.app/teachers

Want to be ready for next week's conferences?

Best,

## Template 4: The "Social Proof" Email
**Subject:** [Mutual Connection] recommended I reach out

Hi [Teacher Name],

[Mutual Connection] mentioned you're always looking for ways to streamline your art classroom workflow.

I created KidCanvas specifically for art teachers drowning in student artwork photos. It's now being used by teachers across [number/location].

The most common feedback: "This saves me at least an hour every week."

Here's what it does:
- Digital portfolio for each student
- Bulk upload from phone or camera
- Parent sharing with one link
- Progress tracking over the school year

Free forever. No ads. Built by an educator.

Would you be open to a 15-minute demo? Or just try it yourself: https://kidcanvas.app/teachers

Thanks,
[Your Name]

## Template 5: The "Problem Agitation" Email
**Subject:** The real reason you're drowning in student artwork photos

Hi [Teacher Name],

Let me guess:

Your camera roll has 847 photos of student artwork. Half are unlabeled. You can't remember which piece belongs to which student. And parent-teacher conferences are next week.

Sound familiar?

The problem isn't that you're disorganized. The problem is that you're using tools (camera roll, Google Photos, folders) that weren't built for teachers.

KidCanvas was built specifically for this:
- Auto-organize by student
- Tag by project type
- Search by date or assignment
- Share instantly with families

Free for teachers. Set up in 5 minutes: https://kidcanvas.app/teachers

Give it a shot?

## Template 6: The "Time Saver" Email
**Subject:** Save 2 hours per week on portfolio management

Hi [Teacher Name],

I did the math:

Photographing student work: 20 minutes/week
Organizing photos: 30 minutes/week
Sharing with parents: 45 minutes/week
Conference prep: 3+ hours

Total: **~7 hours per month** on portfolio management.

KidCanvas cuts that to under 1 hour.

Here's the difference:
- Bulk photo upload (not one-by-one)
- Automatic student organization
- One-click parent sharing
- Built-in conference view

Free for unlimited students: https://kidcanvas.app/teachers

Want those 6 hours back?

Best,
[Your Name]

## Template 7: The "End-of-Year" Email
**Subject:** Don't lose a year's worth of student artwork

Hi [Teacher Name],

End of year is coming. You know what happens...

All those amazing student portfolios get lost when you delete photos to free up phone storage, or files get scattered across devices.

KidCanvas keeps everything organized and backed up:
- Every student's full year of work in one place
- Export portfolios as keepsakes for families
- Carry portfolios forward to next year
- Never lose student work again

It's free for teachers, and setup takes 5 minutes: https://kidcanvas.app/teachers

Preserve this year's work before it's gone?

## Template 8: The "Feature Highlight" Email
**Subject:** The art teacher app with actually useful features

Hi [Teacher Name],

Most "teacher apps" are bloated with features you'll never use.

KidCanvas does exactly 3 things (really well):

1. **Photograph** - Bulk upload from phone/camera, auto-date stamp
2. **Organize** - Tag students, projects, dates (search any artwork in 2 seconds)
3. **Share** - Parent links, conference exports, year-end portfolios

That's it. No gradebook. No lesson planner. No random features.

Just portfolio management that actually works.

Free forever for unlimited students: https://kidcanvas.app/teachers

Try it with one class this week?

Best,
[Your Name]

## Template 9: The "School-Wide" Email
**Subject:** Portfolio system for your entire art department

Hi [Teacher Name],

Quick question: Does your school have a standard system for managing student art portfolios?

If you're like most schools, every teacher has their own method (or no method), making it impossible to track student progress year-over-year.

KidCanvas works school-wide:
- Each teacher manages their own classes
- Students build portfolios across years
- Consistent system from K-12
- Free for all teachers (school license available)

Would you be the right person to discuss this, or should I talk with [Art Department Head/Principal]?

More info: https://kidcanvas.app/teachers

Thanks,
[Your Name]

## Template 10: The "Personal Story" Email
**Subject:** I built this because my wife needed it

Hi [Teacher Name],

Full transparency: I'm not an art teacher.

But my [wife/partner/sister] is. And every Sunday night I watched her spend 2+ hours organizing student artwork photos for the week.

I'm a developer, so I built her a tool to fix it.

Now it:
- Organizes everything by student automatically
- Backs up to the cloud (no lost photos)
- Lets her share with parents in one click
- Works on phone, tablet, or computer

She convinced me to make it available to other teachers. It's completely free.

Happy to answer any questions,
